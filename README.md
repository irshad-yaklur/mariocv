# Mario CV

This is an interactive Mario-style CV inspired by the original project created by @vivirenremoto.

I adapted the concept to present my professional experience in a simple and creative way using a game-based format.

## About This CV

The project uses basic HTML, CSS and JavaScript to simulate a side-scrolling Mario world.  
Each box in the game contains one section of my resume.

Sections included:
- Professional Summary  
- Cerner Healthcare Experience  
- Legato Healthcare Experience  
- Philips India Quality Specialist Experience  
- Medtronic India Experience  
- Philips India Product Owner Experience  
- Certifications and Contact Details
